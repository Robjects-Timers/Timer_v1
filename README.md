Repository overviewing Iteration #1 of Self-Created Timer 



# TIMER_V1
-------------------
### Overview and Table of Contents
This is the first of many iterations of the engineering design process with the intention of making a timer product from scratch. 



##### Context (Problem & Purpose of Repository): 
In today's digital age, it's easy to find ourselves constantly distracted by various forms of media, such as TV, phones, and/or social media. These distractions can significantly hinder our ability to focus and be productive, especially when it comes to accomplishing long-term goals.

This can lead to a cycle of unproductivity, where we want to accomplish tasks but end up not doing so, leading to feelings of frustration and disappointment.

For instance, you might start your day with the intention of working on a project, but find yourself constantly checking your phone for updates, or getting lost in the endless scroll of social media. Before you know it, hours have passed and you've barely made any progress on your work. This can be particularly problematic if you're working on a long-term goal that requires consistent effort over time.

Additionally, this repository will be the first of multiple iterations, with each iteration aimed at improving specific criteria and ultimately creating the best solution using all research and data gathered the final iteration. The iterative approach will allow us to incorporate feedback, address limitations, and create real solutions quickly that may be replicated and exported to suit whatever use case your imagination and persistence grows.
 
 
This iterative design methodology aligns with best practices in solution development, enabling us to progressively enhance the timer's performance and usability based on real-world testing and user feedback.
By continuously refining the solution through successive iterations, we can ensure that the final version of the timer is optimized to effectively mitigate the impact of distractions and support sustained focus on important tasks. 

This timer will help you manage your time more effectively, allowing you to focus on your work and achieve your long-term goals. Additionally, by repetitively partaking in actions that benefit you in the future, the brain is subsequently rewired in a process known as [self-directed neuroplasticity](https://sophia.stkate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1019&context=ma_hhs). For instance, by engaging in repetitive, intentional action, the brain triggers a series of neurological changes. Over time, this leads to the formation of new neural pathways that build cognitive reserve and incredibly make intellectually stimiluating activities seem natural!
