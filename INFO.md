## Context (Problem & Purpose of Repository): 
In today's digital age, it's easy to find ourselves constantly distracted by various forms of media, such as TV, phones, and/or social media. These distractions can significantly hinder our ability to focus and be productive, especially when it comes to accomplishing long-term goals.

This idea resulted from the frustration and problem that occurred from not being able to focus on my tasks due to being distracted from my phone. And while perhaps some of you may just be able to, very admirably, leave your phone with relentless determination, and move on to your long-term goals as effortless as it was to do the other habit.
That being said, we have to be both wise and smart and reduce the amount of mental friction we intend to have to partake; otherwise, I don’t stand a chance changing my behavior and might end up worse than I started from the depression of failure. Due to this, I will work on replacing the worst habit of checking my phone and ‘less worse’ habit such as working on these engineering projects so that either way, I am procrastinating, but I am still inside the mental (and physical) environment that my day-to-day career tasks which might end up indirectly improving my productivity.



## Solutions

I will be creating several iterations of full hardware/software prototypes that use different hardware/software every iteration. The hope is to incrementally increase complexity of builds that stick to specified criteria common for creating tech solutions.

  "why don't you just buy a cheap clock, you goon? Arrr ya dumb or something...?" - online troll somewhere

  My response: Yes... you can solve this problem simply with a quick purchase of a timer, stopwatch from a 1 minute search on Amazon. However, that won't really solve the problem at hand and create a alternative procrastination habit useful for my career goals. Also, where's the fun in buying a solution that won't impact you at your very core increasing the probability of success in defeating your bad habit...? 
  And, where else can you flex your engineering skills from all different fields of engineering, and have a chance to showcase to my fellow engineering community that can laugh or implement their own projects incrementally improving your life in the best way?
